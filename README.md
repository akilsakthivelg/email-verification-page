# Email Verification Page

This repository contains a simple static webpage that is used as a verification success page for my Flutter app's email authentication flow.

When a user clicks the verification link sent by Supabase, they are directed to this page, which tells them to return to the app and log in with their credentials.

## Usage

This page is hosted using GitHub Pages at:  
`https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name/`

## How to update

- Edit the `index.html` file to change the message or styling.
- Commit and push changes to update the live page.
